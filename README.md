These two python scripts are used to create a plot of muon beam facilities around the world and compare where a proposed beam line at Jefferson Lab would rank among them.
The first, plot_muon_facilities.py will plot all the typicaly momentum and max rate of each muon beamline around the world. Split between material science in gray, particle physics in blue, and JLAB momentum and intensity range in black. This is created from a simple comma separated values (csv) file.
The second script creates a plot with horiztonal bars to demonstrate the momentum ccapabilities of all the facilities, NOT each individual line.
