These two Python scripts are used to create a plot of muon beam facilities around the world and compare where a proposed beam line at Jefferson Lab would rank among them.
The first, plot_muon_facilities.py, will plot all the typicaly momentum and max rate of each muon beamline around the world. Split between material science in gray, particle physics in blue, and JLAB momentum and intensity range in black. This is created from a simple comma separated values (csv) file, you can create your own or use muon_facilities.csv


The second script, plot_facilities_range.py, creates a plot with horizontal bars to demonstrate the momentum capabilities of all the facilities, NOT each individual beamline. Use facilities_range.csv or create your own .csv file.

I ran these scripts through Spyder since they automatically save a .png file to your set directory. 

I've also included the large Excel worksheet that contains all the original information, along with reference links.
